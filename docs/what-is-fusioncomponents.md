# What is FusionComponents?

FusionComponents is a large collection of components for varying use cases. It was originally designed to increase development speed for plugins, but has since been expanded to be used in any Roblox project.

## Features

- Built with [Tailwind](https://github.com/virtualbutfake/tailwind) colors and [ThemeFramework](https://github.com/virtualbutfake/theme-framework), providing a consistent look and excellent developer experience.
- 31 components, including buttons, inputs, and modals, suitable for almost every usecase.
- Almost every component can be customized to use any Tailwind color, resulting in a wide range of possible appearances.
- Utilizes [Lucide Icon Set](https://lucide.dev) via [lucide-roblox](https://github.com/virtualbutfake/lucide-roblox), offering a wide range of icons.
- Properties are strongly typed, ensuring a great DX and reducing the risk of runtime errors.
- Seamlessly integrates with your existing Fusion project; Fusion Components tie in with existing codebases and most components take properties that are applied to the instance, for maximum customization.
- Infinite customisability through `AppearanceOverride`s, allowing you to change any aspect of a component's appearance.
- Straightforward theming: Through ThemeFramework, colors, transparencies and shadows for any state can be customized with ease on any component.
- Inspired by Nuxt UI, providing variants that can be used to change the appearance of a component to one of the predefined styles, without having to customize anything else.
