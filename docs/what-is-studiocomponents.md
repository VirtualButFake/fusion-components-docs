# What is FusionComponents?

FusionComponents is a collection of Fusion components for use in plugins.

## Features

- 31 components, designed with a large set of use cases in mind.
- [Custom theming engine](https://github.com/VirtualButFake/ThemeFramework) for easy customization and seamless transitioning between themes, and built-in support for different states of components, which can all be individually customized externally.
- Built-in support for the [Lucide icon set](https://lucide.dev/) through [lucide-roblox](https://github.com/VirtualButFake/lucide-roblox) for a consistent icon set, with every icon available for use in all components.
- Fully typed: every component provides IntelliSense for all of its properties.
- Inspired by [Nuxt UI](https://github.com/nuxt/ui) and built with Tailwind colors for sufficient contrast and consistency across the board.
